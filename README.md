# Coding Quiz

## Description

- Another simple(ish!) Javascript app, looping through a few interesting questions.

- This app uses DOM manipulation to create, change or remove elements within document window.

- With User input, questions are displayed and looped through until either the timer ends or all questions are answered.

- At the end of the game, the user is able to input their initials and store their result to local storage.
